Basic android-build.linaro.org command-line client
==================================================

This tool provides proof-of-concept command-line client for Linaro Android
Build Jenkins master (android-build.linaro.org), as an alternative for
existing Web UI interface. One particular feature the command-line client
has and Web UI lacks is support for creating completely private builds (such
builds are not availabel via Web UI at all). At the same time, this tool is
so far in the proof of concept stage and provides only basic job management
actions (namely, create a job and schedule its build). If you find this tool
useful, please share your comments and suggestion using this bugtracker:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/linaro-android-infrastructure

to help its improvement and evolution.


Quick start
-----------

1. You should have access to Jenkins at:

http://android-build.linaro.org/jenkins/

(Generally available for Linaro Android team members).

2. Download android-build-client tool. As it is written to depend only
on Python standard library, an easy way to get it is to download seperate
file via Launchpad BZR viewer:

wget "http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~linaro-automation/linaro-android-build-tools/trunk/download/head:/androidbuildclient-20130724114943-yefh8succov70g5i-2/android-build-client"
chmod +x android-build-client

3. Look up your Jenkins API token by visiting
https://android-build.linaro.org/jenkins/me/configure and clicking
"Show API Token..." button.

4. Run:

./android-build-client authorize

Enter yous Jenkins username and API token. Note that this will cache these
credentials in your home dir, so use this only on your personal well-protected
workstation. The alternative is to use --user switch and input API key
interactively.

5. To create a new job, prepare an Android job config (see
https://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android/LinaroAndroidBuildService for more
info) in a file. Run:

./android-build-client create <job_name> <job_config_file>

Note that job name should conform to Android Build Service naming
converntions, see documentation link above for more info. To create a job
private for a particular group, pass --private=<group> switch to create command.

6. To schedule a build, run:

./android-build-client build <job_name>


Run ./android-build-client --help to see all options.
