This is a script to query Jenkins job configs, on the level of raw XML files.

Run ./query-jobs --help for list of optoins.


Example usage:

./query-jobs //hudson.triggers.TimerTrigger --filter

    List all regularly repeating jobs.

./query-jobs "disabled='false' and //hudson.triggers.TimerTrigger" --filter

    List all regularly repeating jobs, taking into account that some of them may be
    disabled.

./query-jobs //hudson.triggers.TimerTrigger/spec --filter -v

    List crontab specs for all regularly repeating jobs.

./query-jobs //daysToKeep --filter-not --filter-jobname='-(release|toolchain)'

    List daily (not toolchain and not release) jobs which don't have build
    expriation configured (i.e. would use up disk space without limit).
